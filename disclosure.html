        <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>

        <p><strong>Last updated: January 2025</strong></p>

        <h2>FTC Disclosure</h2>
        <p>In accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR Part 255, "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising," we disclose the following:</p>

        <h2>Amazon Associates Program</h2>
        <p>Useful Tech Hub is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.</p>

        <p>When you click on product links on this site and make a purchase on Amazon, we may receive a small commission at no additional cost to you. This commission helps support our website and allows us to continue providing free content.</p>

        <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
        <p>Our affiliate relationships do NOT influence our editorial content. We recommend products based on:</p>
        <ul style="margin: 15px 0 15px 30px;">
            <li>Hands-on testing when possible</li>
            <li>Thorough research and comparison</li>
            <li>User reviews and feedback</li>
            <li>Value for money</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will never recommend a product solely because it offers a higher commission. If we don't think a product is worth buying, we won't recommend it regardless of potential earnings.</p>

        <h2>Product Prices</h2>
        <p>Product prices and availability are accurate as of the date/time indicated and are subject to change. Any price and availability information displayed on Amazon at the time of purchase will apply to your purchase.</p>

        <h2>Questions?</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about our affiliate relationships or how we select products to review, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
